# Sentence-Correction-Using-RNN 

**Problem Statement:** 

Given a text message that contains corruputed english language(like social media text messages), we need to convert those messages to standard Standard English text. 
**Data Overview: **

In this Modern World everything has become Digitalized. Everyone in the World has atleast one Mobile phone or computer.Due to evolution, messages to be delivered to people are done via Mobile phones or computers.These are fast and easy way for communication. Moreover most of the pepole in world now started to use short forms for conveying messages. So while performing various NLP based text Problems, the words need better text preprocessing to get better performance.So by using various RNN techniques we can improve the text or correct the incorrect text to a standard English so that it can help ML or DL to get better Performance on NLP based Models. The dataset is around 2000 text messages which contains both incorrect and correct sentence. 

**Example1: **
-->Input:'U wan me to "chop" seat 4 u nt?' 
             
-->Output:'Do you want me to reserve seat for you or not?' 
**Example2: **
-->Input:'Yup. U reaching. We order some durian pastry already. U come quick.'
             
-->Output:'Yeap. You reaching? We ordered some Durian pastry already. You come quick.' 

**Business Objective and Constraints: **

Since this could be used for preprocessing there is not much requirement for very faster results.
